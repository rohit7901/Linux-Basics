                                                                 Chapter 3.ACCESSING FILES
  
-To view files permissions & ownership on the file & directory use 'ls -al' command
       Suppose the output is in following form ,
           dr-xr-x---.  4 root root 4096 Jul 25  2019 .
           dr-xr-xr-x. 18 root root 4096 Jul 25  2019 ..
           -rw-r--r--.  1 root root   18 Dec 29  2013 .bash_logout
           -rw-r--r--.  1 root root  176 Dec 29  2013 .bash_profile
           -rw-r--r--.  1 root root  176 Dec 29  2013 .bashrc
           -rw-r--r--.  1 root root  100 Dec 29  2013 .cshrc
           -rw-r--r--.  1 root root    0 Nov 19  2017 .hushlogin
           -rw-------.  1 root root 2150 Nov 19  2017 original-ks.cfg
           drwxr-----.  3 root root 4096 Jul 25  2019 .pki
           drwxr-xr-x.  2 root root 4096 Nov 19  2017 .ssh
           -rw-r--r--.  1 root root  129 Dec 29  2013 .tcshrc 
    Here if the first letter is d then it represents it is directory else it represents ther files.
    There are following representetion for the permissions-
         r - read(4)      w - write(2)      x - execute(1)
    First three are for the owner permisssion , next theree are for the group permission ,last three are for the others permission.
      No Permission	               ---
	    Execute	                     --x
	    Write	                       -w-
	    Execute + Write	             -wx
	    Read	                       r--
	    Read + Execute	             r-x
	    Read + Write	               rw-
	    Read + Write +Execute	       rwx  
-Commands for permissions and accessing the the files.
    =>chmod - chmod stands for change mode used to change the permissions associated with the files.
        Suppose we are provided the following information about the file
              -rw-------.  1 root root 2150 Nov 19  2017 myfile.txt
               From this information we can conclude that , owner is having permission for read & write, groups and others are not havving any permissions.
                       Suppose we are asked to change permissions for the above file as following we have to assign all permissions for the user, 
                       read & write permission for the 
                       groups & only read permission for the others.Then we will make the command execute in the following order:
                              'chmod 751 myfile.txt'
    =>chown -used to change the owner of the file 
            Example, suppose we have the owner of file from root to rohit then we will use command in the following way.
                       sudo chown rohit :: admin myfile.txt

-SELinux stands for Security Enhanced Linux
-It is the security architecture for Linux systems
-It allows administrators to have more control on who can access the system .

Modes of SELinux -
   1.Disabled - In this mode no SELinux policy is loaded.
   2.Enabled 
       A.Active- security policy is enforced in this type of mode.
       B.Permissive- In permissive mode instead of enforcing security policy, it prints warnings.

Commands- 
1. getinforce - to enforce the privacy policy
2. sestatus - to get information about the current status of SELinux 

To ENABLE/DISABLE SELinux follow the following steps :
   1. vi /etc/se
   2. vi /etc/selinux/config     After this it will enable you to change the mode of SELinux.
