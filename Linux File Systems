                                                             Chapter 1 â€“ Linux File System
1.1 Introduction
         Linux file system manages the file name, file size, creation date and more information about the file. 
         It is mainly consists of the root directory and its sub directories.It also helps to arrange the data storage.


1.2 Basic Commands -
    pwd - pwd stands for present working directory used to get information about current directory
    cd - it is used for changing the directory 
    ls - used to list the files present in the current directory 
    touch file_name - to create file name 
            Example, touch myfile.txt - it will create the text file with name of myfile
    echo "hello" >> filename.txt - this will insert text 'hello' in the given file
    cat file_name - used to display content of the given file
            Example, cat filename.txt
            Output =>  hello
    cp -r - used to copy all files recursively.
    mv - to rename the file 
            Example,  mv filename.txt myfile.txt
    rm - to remove files
    head - to get info about top files instead of all files
            Example, ls |head -5 => it will list down top 5 files
    tail - similar as head but instead of top files it will list down last files 
    ping - used to check the working of the network
    top - it is used to get the usage of CPU 
    uname - this command will give you the the current version of Linux that you are using 
    vi - a text editor basically.After opening vi press i to perform the insert operation then press ESCAPE to return to the command line then type wq to save and exit 
    cd / - to shift to root user 
    mkdir - to make a directory
    rmdir - used to remove an empty directory  


1.3 About directories and its types-
 
 Now lets focus on the types of directories :-
     1./bin - this is the directory that command & some of the applications and programs you can run.
     2./boot - it contains the boot files that are required to start device.
     3./dev - device files are stored in this directory likewise if hard disk or other devices are monuted then information about that mounted device will be stored here.
     4./etc - in /etc directory the system configuration is present.
     5./home - /home directory will contain user's personal directories.
     6./lib - this /lib directory will provide libraries for the commands.
     7./media - it is the directory where the external storage will be mounted when plugged in.
     8./mnt - directory where we maunally mount storage or partitions.
     9./opt - acts like extra hard disk
     10./proc - it is the virtual directory which stores the information of CPU & Kernel process.
     11./root - known as the home directory of the Administrator .
     12./temp - directory used when system boots and you need to use temp space
     13./usr - contains unique system resources 
     14./var - used to store data that changes frequently. 
 
         
1.4 Soft Links Vs Hard Links 
    ln - command used to link files
    ln -li = it will show the inode number.
    df -h => it will give information about the file system with memory usage and mounted directory for the file.
    
    Hard Link 
     1.Hard links are having the same inode number pointing to the same file.
     2.These cannot be used on directories.
     3.Example, ln source.txt hardlink.txt it will create hard link for the given file
     
    Soft Links 
     1.Commonly known as symbolic link.
     2.Have capacity to link files on diffrent systems.
     3.Can be used on directory.
     4.Example, ls -s source.txt softlink.txt => this will create soft link for the file
